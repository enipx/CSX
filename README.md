# Introduction

CSX is a UI design system and CSS framework based on utilities and components that allows you to build your product faster

## Motivation

There were several reasons why CSX was created.

First and foremost, it was created to provide you with various utilities and customizable components needed to create a beautiful, consistent, and responsive app at speed.

Additionally, CSX help improves the maintainability of a website by providing a well-structured and modular approach to styling (EMMET). This can make it easier to update and modify the design of a website over time without having to rewrite large amounts of CSS code. 

## Progress

I started working on CSX earlier in 2020. Unfortunately, I stopped working on it after a month due to my job schedule, and ever since, I have yet to have the time to complete it. Since I'm likely not able to get to this anymore, I decided to make the project publicly available for anyone interested in picking the project up or its approaches.

Here's a quick overview of key features which are still missing in CSX

- Optimization
- More JS frameworks compatibility
- Improving the documentation and making tutorials
- Testing and debugging
- And more!

However, If you're interested in contributing on the project, here's how you can get started:

- Fork the project repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
- Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository with a detailed description of your changes and why they are necessary.

Thank you for your interest!
